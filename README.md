Design of Microstrip Patch Antenna Using ANSYS HFSS SOFTWARE


What do we propose? 

We propose, a microwave-assisted, microstrip patch antenna based in-home hydroponic farming technology that enables indoor, urban warehouse-based farming, food production to uplift a high-density in-home lifestyle and food security despite having a future consisting of unstable climate changes and frangibility.

The insight behind this technology is working towards an agricultural system that is independent of weather, transportation and various other dependencies ensuring people a certain level of food security and self-dependency.


A signal generator generates microwaves of 2.45GHz. Those microwaves are amplified up to 50 Watt by an amplifier. Amplified microwaves are radiated to the target plans by a microstrip patch antenna.

LED illumination is required for the growth of the plants. A combination of 30% blue LED and 70% red LED is provided at the target plants.
Sensors as BH1750 (illuminometer), DHT11 and LM35 (humidity and temperature measurement) are connected to the ATmega2560, Arduino Mega for the data logger system.

In the germination procedure the roots are supplied with the nutrient solution which fulfills its requirement of water as well as nutrients.  Heating the crops are a prior factor for a year-round successful crop production.
